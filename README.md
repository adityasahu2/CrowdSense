# CrowdSense

## AI-Powered Smart Crowd Management & Chaos Prediction System

### 🚀 Overview
CrowdSense is a multi-modal AI system designed for real-time crowd monitoring, chaos prediction, security enhancement, and optimized movement flow. It leverages AI-powered analytics to ensure safer gatherings, smarter cities, and improved security measures.

### 🏆 Key Features
1. **Real-time AI crowd density monitoring** via CCTV and image analysis.
2. **Chaos detection & prevention** to mitigate stampedes and congestion.
3. **Threat detection** using AI models for identifying weapons, gunshots, and distress signals.
4. **Dynamic route optimization** for smooth crowd movement.
5. **AI-based missing persons identification** using facial recognition.
6. **Mobile application and web dashboard** for event managers, law enforcement, and the general public.

### 🚨 Problem Statement
- Overcrowding at large-scale events poses security threats like stampedes.
- Manual monitoring lacks predictive capabilities and efficiency.
- No real-time system currently exists to forecast overcrowding and alert authorities.
- Security threats (unauthorized weapons, gunshots, blasts) often go undetected.
- Identifying missing persons in large crowds is resource-intensive.
- No AI-driven solution exists to optimize movement flow in crowded areas.
